# Advent of Code 2022

This year I decided to mix up my approach again. 

Rather than writing a single script for each day, I'm developing a package: Elfy.

The idea is to basically add all the required functionality for each day to the package, and just sort of see where it goes as I continue development. 

Given how different each challenge tends to be, It's likely going to end up as an insane mess, but that's kind of the point.
